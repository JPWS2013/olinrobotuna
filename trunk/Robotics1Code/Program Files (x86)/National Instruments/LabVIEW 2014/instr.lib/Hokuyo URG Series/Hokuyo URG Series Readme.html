<h4>2. Required Software</h4>
Some software components need to be installed before using
this
instrument driver. The minimum versions of these components are listed
below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.
<br>
<br>
NI-VISA 4.6 <br>
Hokuyo URG USB Driver
<br>
<br>
Refer to the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> for more information
about software requirements. You access the <i>LabVIEW Help</i>
by selecting <i>Help&raquo;Search the LabVIEW Help</i>.<br>
<br>
To create a VISA Ethernet device for ethernet-based LIDAR units open
Measure and Automation Explorer (MAX) and complete the following steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on <strong>Devices and Interfaces</strong>
and select Create New. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Select <strong>VISA TCP/IP Resource </strong>from
the list.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Raw Socket</strong> radio
button and enter the IP Address and Port Number as specified by the
manual for your instrument. The default IP of&nbsp;Hokuyo LIDARs is
192.168.0.10 and the port is 10940</li>
  <li>You can then give your TCP/IP Resource a <strong>VISA
alias</strong>. Follow the rest of the wizard&rsquo;s instructions.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You should see your device listed under <strong>VISA
TCP/IP Resources</strong>.</li>
</ol>
For ethernet-based LIDAR units on CompactRIO use the device string
TCP0::&lt;IP ADDRESS OF UNIT&gt;::10940::SOCKET. The default IP
of&nbsp;Hokuyo LIDARs is 192.168.0.10
<h4>3. Known Issues</h4>
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver,
please send an email to <a href="mailto:instrument.drivers@ni.com">instrument.drivers@ni.com</a>.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you are upgrading your existing application from version
1.0 to
version 2.x of the instrument driver, the upgraded Initialize VI will
be broken if a value is not connected to the Protocol connector on the
connector pane. The Protocol input is now required because the 2.x
version of the instrument driver only supports SCIP 2.0. If your
application requires the use of SCIP 1.1, please continue using Version
1.0 of the instrument driver.</li>
  <li>
Although the support for the&nbsp;UHG-08LX, and UBG-04LX-F01 has
been implemented in this driver, they have not been tested.</li>
  <li>Not all VIs or settings in a VI in this instrument driver
are fully
supported by all instruments models. This is documented throughout the
instrument driver. Refer to instrument documentation for more details
pertaining to your specific model. &nbsp;Examples of some potential
differences in models:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>UTM-30LX
returns a command error when attempting to configure serial baud rate
(device does not have a serial interface), but URG-04LX accepts command
regardless of whether it is connected by USB or serial.</li>
    <li>Though documented in the SCIP 2.0 spec, no device tested
works with configure laser sensitivity mode</li>
    <li>The
UTM-30LX device accepts 2-byte encoding instructions when acquiring
data, but returns the same data as if it were issued a 3-byte command
resulting in bad data.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Once an instrument is put into time
configuration mode through the Match Time VI, the only commands
accepted by the instrument will be Match Time commands until it is
taken out of this mode or the instrument is power cycled.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Revision History</h4>
The latest version of this and other LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI
instrument drivers can be downloaded at the <a
 href="http://www.ni.com/idnet">Instrument Driver Network</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
REV 1.0, 06/20/2008
<br>
Modified By: Logan Lamb, Austin, TX.
<br>
Original Release.
<br>
<br>
REV 2.0, 02/10/2008
<br>
Modified By: Travis Mansfield, Austin, TX.
<br>
Overhaul of driver to improve design, and add functionality. &nbsp;<br>
<ul>
  <li>Support
for SCIP 1.1 has been deprecated, however all known Hokuyo Lidar
drivers previously supported have the capability of working with driver
version 2.0. &nbsp;If your driver was using SCIP 1.1 protocol,
refer to
your instrument's manual to determine how to configure your instrument
to use SCIP 2.0, and make modifications to any VIs which use the
instrument driver's initialize VI.</li>
  <li>The following public VIs were added to the instrument
driver:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Configure Laser Sensitivity</li>
    <li>Sensor Specification</li>
    <li>Match Time</li>
    <li>Sensor State</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Error handling was greatly improved to return errors
specific to each command, and general command errors</li>
  <li>The following VIs were changed:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Reset? input added</li>
      <li>ID Query? input added</li>
      <li>Protocol
input gives error for SCIP 1.1 mode, but has a new input "Convert to
latest" which attempts to put a SCIP 1.1 instrument into SCIP 2.0 mode</li>
      <li>Protocol
input is now required. &nbsp;If unwired before, your VI will break
after upgrading (the old default was SCIP 1.1 is not supported, so a VI
change needed to be made).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Configure
Serial Baud Rate</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The VI now sets the VISA baud rate after setting the
instrument's serial baud rate, existing code which set the VISA
property node after calling this VI should continue to function</li>
      <li>The VI waits one second after issuing the command to
the instrument to give the instrument command time to take effect</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Acquire Data</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A&nbsp;new Data Encoding Width input was added to
specify whether you would like to perform a 2 or 3 byte encoded data
read</li>
      <li>A
major bug was fixed in the VI which corrects incorrect computation of
the Direction output on instruments other than the URG-04LX which may
have different front steps and angular resolutions than the URG-04LX</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Configure Laser Power - Ignore Errors input was added</li>
    <li>Close - was modifed to attempt to turn off the
instrument's laser regardless of whether or not an error is input to
the VI</li>
    <li>VI Tree, and&nbsp;palette menus -&nbsp;modified
to include the new VIs</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
REV 2.1, 08/20/2009<br>
Modified By: Nicu Stiurca, Austin, TX.
<br>
Modified driver to work on cRIO.<br>
<ul>
  <li>The following VIs were renamed:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize renamed to Initialize-Standard. This VI still
does all the initialization.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The following VIs were created:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize-cRIO USB</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A simple wrapper which typecasts the VISA resource type
to the type expected by Initialize-Standard.vi.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Initialize</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Polymorphic VI composed of Initialize-Standard (ie, the
old Initialize) and Initialize-cRIO USB.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>The following VIs were modified:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hokuyo URG Series Configure and Acquire Data</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses the new (polymorphic) Initialize.vi.</li>
      <li>Graph no longer uses a logarithmic scale.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize-Instr (ie, the old Initialize)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Only tries to set serial-specific attributes if the
underlying type of the VISA resource is Serial.</li>
      <li>No longer configures the VISA resource to automatically
append the termination character to all messages.</li>
      <li>Added UHG-08LX to the list of officially supported
models.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Query Instrument</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Appends
every command with a termination character (newline) since VISA cannot
be configured to do so automatically regardless of whether the
underlying resource type is Serial or USB Raw.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
